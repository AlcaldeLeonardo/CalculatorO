# Calculator proposed by Odin Project
## Mostly made with JS
I have used DOM manipulation to render absolutely the entire calculator on the screen. Taking as the root the only manually written div in the index.html with class "container" I have begun to add with the vanilla javascript DOM methods.

This is also how I have added the calculator's own functions through js.

### Problems that arose along the way
The problems that caused me the most difficulties were the floating point, the fact that I could not add, multiply or divide correctly, each operation was out of date. In each resolution I marked a commit with more details for the reader.

### Skills that I wanted to reinforce with this exercise

- modularity
- Object-oriented programming
-BEM
- Complete DOM manipulation
- manipulation of strings with different methods
- casting of data types
- make each function as simple as possible
- create a minimalist but functional style in CSS
- render absolutely everything, or at least most of it, through js
